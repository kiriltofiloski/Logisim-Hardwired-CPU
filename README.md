# Logisim-Hardwired-CPU
In this project, I used a Micro-programmed CPU model MiMo provided by my faculty FRI through the Computer Organization course. I replaced the decision and control ROM with Decode Logic to create a hardwired version of the CPU.

NOTE: I did not program the assembler, that was provided by my faculty.

To test a program simply run : **.\assembler.exe example_program.s** from the command prompt. This will create a RAM image that can be loaded in the RAM module in the circuit.
